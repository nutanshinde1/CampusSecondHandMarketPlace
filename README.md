## ⚙ Technologies Used

- C++
- Qt 6 (Qt Widgets)
- CMake
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

---

## 🎯 OOP Concepts Implemented

### ✅ Abstraction
- `Product`
- `User`

Both are abstract base classes using pure virtual functions.

### ✅ Inheritance

```
Product
│
├── Book
├── Electronics
└── Clothing

User
│
├── Buyer
└── Seller
```

### ✅ Polymorphism

Each product overrides

```cpp
getDetails()
```

to display category-specific information.

### ✅ Encapsulation

Private data members accessed using getters and setters.

### ✅ Composition

A `Listing` object contains a `Product`.

### ✅ Operator Overloading

Comparison operators implemented for products based on price.
